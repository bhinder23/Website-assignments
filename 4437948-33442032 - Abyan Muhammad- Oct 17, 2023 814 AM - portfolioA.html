            I started high school as a part of the I-STEM Program, a decision I do not regret. This program takes a bit more of a hands-on approach to the typical curriculum, and I feel that it has helped me develop some essential skills that could be very useful in the real world. We are constantly creating prototypes and iterating with the purpose of leaving a positive impact on the world.

            <p>
                In this project, we were tasked with creating some sort of product/service, and then pitching it to the public.
                This project really helped develop my conversation and people skills. We were constantly talking to different people, and I was constantly forced to think and react on the fly while pitching our idea to strangers. Even the simple things like taking feedback and answering questions we may or may not have been ready for were a valuable experience that taught me a lot.

            <p>
                In grade 9, we were given an opportunity to work with the city in order to develop a solution for the erosion occurring behind our school.This project played a significant role in the development of my problem-solving skills. I faced many obstacles throughout the process, one of which being working effectively through the pandemic, but we worked hard and were able to overcome these obstacles while constantly improving our solution proposal for the ravine. We were one of the top teams at the end of that project.

            <p>
                For this project, we were tasked with using micro-bits to develop a solution to an environmental problem. Through this project I was able to learn some coding basics. Thanks to this and the computer science course offered at Aldershot, I have gained a solid foundation in programming.

            <h2>YPI PROJECT</h2>
            <p>
                The Goal of this project was to research a local charity and create a proposal, trying to win a money prize to donate to that charity. Although my group may not have won the grant, I still think that it was an incredibly valuable experience. It was a way for us to get involved with the community and create meaningful connections with those trying to make a difference in our local community.
