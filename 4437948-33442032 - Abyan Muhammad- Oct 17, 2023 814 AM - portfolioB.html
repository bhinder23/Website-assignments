            Hi, my name is Baqir. I'm a seventeen-year-old, grade twelve student at Aldershot high school in the I-STEM program. My hobbies include photo and video editing, graphic design, art, and video game design. I enjoy technological studies as I feel they are the advancements of the future. Some of the main reasons I was so drawn towards the I-STEM program is because it is heavily technology-based, and I enjoy creation-based projects because I find them to be a lot more rewarding and enjoyable to look back on as a learning experience. I previously struggled with independent learning and wanted to get better at it. As such, I was drawn into the I-STEM program as they had mentioned that a lot of the I-STEM work would be independent.

            <p>
                In this project, we were tasked with creating some sort of product/service, and then pitching it to the public.
                This project really helped develop my conversation and people skills. We were constantly talking to different people, and I was constantly forced to think and react on the fly while pitching our idea to strangers. Even the simple things like taking feedback and answering questions we may or may not have been ready for were a valuable experience that taught me a lot.

            <h2>Combustion rockets</h2>
            <p>
                We had just finished building bottle rockets when we swiftly switched to building combustion rockets. The rocket itself was different, despite the fact that the concept was the same, thus we had to utilize alternative designs to complement the thin rocket. In the end, my rocket was mostly successful, and the parachute opened at the appropriate height, but the man inside melted. I improved my ability to work swiftly and accurately as a result of this assignment. I found it worthwhile because I have trouble working rapidly and now recognize the value of correctness and time.

            <h2>UN-SDG podcast project</h2>
            <p>
                For this project, we had to conduct research on a subject and connect it to the UNSDG that we were given. My group chose to discuss dictatorships and the impact they had on the world and the UNSDGs. This project was great because it improved my improvisation and communication skills, which are areas where I often struggle in.

            <h2>Leadership project</h2>
            <p>
                This was one of the most significant projects of the year for me because I learned how to work well with others, conduct excellent research, and comprehend the value of presentation practise. For the Leadership project, we were required to identify a problem with the school to fix or improve. Our group decided to address the washroom vaping scene, and we found an amazing solution that we were content with.
